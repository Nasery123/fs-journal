# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

1.  What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

> | synchronous is happening at the same time but asynchronouse is the opposite. it means that asynchronous is happening in a different time sections |

2.  What is an event listener?

> | an event listener is a methode that waits untill the some thing happen like when user clicks and then call the function. |

3.  What does _REST_ stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

> | Rest stands for representational state transform. |

4.  What is a callback / higher order function?

> | it is a function that has another function as an argument. |

5.  What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

> |it is a proxy value and it is used in asynchronouse code for error handling.
> when the promise fails and the code does not run the methd that is called catch will capture the error |

6.  Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

> | get, put, post, create and delet |

7.  What does the `API` acronym stand for?

> | Application Programming Interface |

8.  What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

> | we should declare our function as async function and use the await key word in front of the promise in order to wait for the promise result.|

9.  What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

> | it is used to package or bandle data to make them private access or make our data secure so others can not access them publicly |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

> | it replies with 200k that shows the request is successfull |

11. What is a 400 error?

> | it means that due to some problem the request can not or will not run |
