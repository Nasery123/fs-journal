# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week? almost nothing or probably because it was a difficult week I thin I made no progress
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise? I learned MVC but since I could not learn it as good as I can do my lab-projects I really feel depressed and nervouse.
- What are you struggling with? still struggling with MVC to learn and make progress.
- What would you count as a victory? figuring out some thing about mvc
